# Exploratory Study on Web Scraping and Database Management

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository where I document my explorations into web scraping, database interactions, and API usage. This space serves as a learning diary, where I delve into different technologies to understand and implement solutions for real-world data handling scenarios.

## Study Areas

### MongoDB Database Operations
- **Connection and Setup**: Establishing a MongoDB connection using `pymongo`.
- **Data Manipulation**: Creating, reading, updating, and storing data in MongoDB.
- **API Integration**: Fetching and storing data from the IPStack API to enrich database entries with geolocation information.

### Web Scraping Techniques
- **Dynamic Web Interaction**: Using Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with web elements on eBay, tailored to filter and retrieve specific product information.
- **HTML Parsing**: Employing BeautifulSoup to parse downloaded HTML files for detailed analysis and data extraction.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Databases**: MongoDB
- **Libraries**: Selenium, BeautifulSoup, pymongo, requests

## Getting Started
To replicate or explore the studies, install the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install pymongo selenium beautifulsoup4 requests
